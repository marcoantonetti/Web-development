    <h1> Cinema Hub</h1>
    <p>There are thousands of shows and each of them are 6 hours long at best.
        Aren`t you tired of wasting long hours of your time on shows that you dont finish? On shows that just not good enough? 
        or shows that arent made for you. In cinemahub We only display the most prestigious TV-Shows of all time. Search by specific Categores or by tags</p>

             <h2>Categories</h2><!---I am thinking wether to put shows as mini categories 
                behing each category or to put each category as hiperlinks which will display said shows. This is because I am limited by my knowledge -->
